## Contribution

This project has help from [`pipenv`](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) in managing dependencies. After cloning this repo (and installing `pipenv`), run `pipenv install` to install the dependencies and `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment (so your other python dependencies don't get messed up).
